      <p class='description'>How Nutanix Soft was created
      </p>

      <p>
        We released Nutanix Soft in 2015. This was months of discussion and testing before we commited to creating our own typeface.
      </p>
      <p> The discussion for chosing a different typeface happened early on, while designing Xi. I was the lead visual designer for the project and was conceptualizing a different direction for our first cloud service. <br>
      I wanted to solve some of the issues we struggled in the past, I knew a font choices were affecting legibility, but most people have gone used to them. It was once I started working on the responsive behavior of our interface that I knew we needed to rethink how our typeface rendered in different devices with a range of different pixel densities.</p>


      <h3>Evaluation</h3><p>
      Initially we chose to evaluate different typefaces with better legibility. We tried fonts from the popular ones web-fotns like Open Sans to system fonts.<br> It was clear to us that our product personality was tighly associated with the rounded nature of our typeface. <br> And it was not until after testing more rounded fonts that we decided that we were going to create one catered to our interfaces. Nutanix Soft was born.</p>


        <h3> The process </h3>
        <p>
        Our initial discussions focused on the current typeface attributes we wanted to maintain and use cases it was not able to support. We strived to create a typeface that was scalable in low-res phone devices and high density desktop displays while maitining the product brand aesthetic.</p>

        <ol type="A">
          <li>It needed to include more weights. </li>
          <li>It needed to fixed upon a line-height issue we had.</li>
          <li>It needed to render a sharp a wide range of pixel density displays</li>
        </ol>


      <p> We started analysing all glyphs of the typeface under all conditions, determining how the next iteration of our product typeface should evolve. We referenced clear typefaces like San Francisco and Proxima Nova, which were developed with multi devices in mind.
