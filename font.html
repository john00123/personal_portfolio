      <p class='description'>Creation of a font that retains our product personality but improve legibility for lower resolution displays.
      </p>

      <h3> Overview</h3>
      <p>This project started during 2015. As the company moved to developing  multiple products, there was the increasing need to review our typeface as well as our typographic hierarchy.
      The goal was to create a typeface that would retain most of personality attributes while improving on multi device legibility.</p>

      <p>
        Our visual design team worked with Matt
        Nutanix hardware installation process was fragmented. Datacenter admins needed to keep track on the inventory and the state of each piece of hardware through an excell sheet, retype network information manually to another platform and use this same information to register the product. An inefficient and costly process to company, partners and our customers that was prone to human error as it relies on administrators to keep track of all moving parts.

        <form layout='‚äü' id='nutanix-soft-sizing'>
          <input id='font-sizing' name='input-Range'type="range" step='20' min='80' max='200' value="80">
        </form>

      <h3>The challenge</h3>

      <p>Nutanix during that period provided only <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software' target="_blank">on-premises</a> solutions. For the vast majority of our clients that meant that no communication outside the datacenter for security purposes.
      <br><br>
      To create a secure channel I needed a way to establish a local connection between the hardware and the system, for this reason using a companion app as the orchestration layer was a core part of this concept. It was portable, accesible and easy to develop a prototype for a POC.</p>

    <h3>What is next for the font</h3>
    <p> Today we continue to improve upon our typeface by standarizing it's usage across the company. Today there are dialogs with the marketing team to improve the font to cater to large print formats.</p>
