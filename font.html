      <h3> Overview</h3>
      <p>Nutanix in 2015 was exploring mobile products, it was during that period that we decided to take a overdue look at our current typeface and revise how we use type in our product offerings.</p>

      <p>
        Nutanix hardware installation process was fragmented. Datacenter admins needed to keep track on the inventory and the state of each piece of hardware through an excell sheet, retype network information manually to another platform and use this same information to register the product. An inefficient and costly process to company, partners and our customers that was prone to human error as it relies on administrators to keep track of all moving parts.

        <span class='sizing'> a </span>
        <input id='font-sizing' type="range" name="font-size" min='80' max='200' value="80">
      </div>

      <h3>The challenge</h3>

      <p>Nutanix during that period provided only <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software' target="_blank">on-premises</a> solutions. For the vast majority of our clients that meant that no communication outside the datacenter for security purposes.
      <br><br>
      To create a secure channel I needed a way to establish a local connection between the hardware and the system, for this reason using a companion app as the orchestration layer was a core part of this concept. It was portable, accesible and easy to develop a prototype for a POC.</p>


    <h3>What is next for the font</h3>
    <p> Today we continue to improve upon our typeface by standarizing it's usage across the company. Today there are dialogs with the marketing team to improve the font to cater to large print formats.</p>
