      <p class='description'>How Nutanix Soft was created
      </p>

      <p>Today Nutanix Soft is our products base typeface. This typeface was the result an increasing need to review our typeface as well as our typographic hierarchy in product back in 2015.</p>

      <h3> A new typeface </h3>
      <p>
        As we started designing platforms outside of our main interface, we realized that our current set of fonts did not scale with our product needs. <br><br>
        Initiallly we evaluated different fonts from the more popular Open Sans, to an approach similar to what Atlassian does which is defaulting system fonts in our interface, but it was clear that our product personality was tighly associated with the rounded nature of our typeface so we decided to take the opportunity to create a new typeface.

        <br><br>
        Our initial discussions focused on the current typeface attributes we wanted to maintain and use cases it was not able to support. We strived to create a typeface that was scalable in low-res phone devices and high density desktop displays while maitining the product brand aesthetic.

        <ol type="A">
          <li>It needed to include more weights. </li>
          <li>It needed to fixed upon a line-height issue we had.</li>
          <li>It needed to render a sharp a wide range of pixel density displays</li>
        </ol>

      </p>
      <p> We started analysing all glyphs of the typeface under all conditions, determining how the next iteration of our product typeface should evolve. We referenced clear typefaces like San Francisco and Proxima Nova, which were developed with multi devices in mind.
