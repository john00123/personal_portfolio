      <p class='description'>How Nutanix Soft was created
      </p>

      <p>Today Nutanix Soft is our products main typeface. It was the result an increasing need to review our typeface as well as our font hierarchy in product back in 2015.</p>

      <h3> A new typeface </h3>
      <p>
        As we started designing new platforms outside of our main interface Prism, we realized that the typeface we used before did not scale with our changing product needs. <br><br>
        Initially we evaluated different typefaces from the popular ones like Open Sans and San Francisco, to system fonts and how it fit with our platforms. It was clear to us that our product personality was tighly associated with the rounded nature of our typeface. <br> And it was not until after testing more rounded fonts that we decided that we were going to create one catered to our interfaces. Nutanix Soft was born.</p>
        <h3> The process </h3>
        <p>
        Our initial discussions focused on the current typeface attributes we wanted to maintain and use cases it was not able to support. We strived to create a typeface that was scalable in low-res phone devices and high density desktop displays while maitining the product brand aesthetic.</p>

        <ol type="A">
          <li>It needed to include more weights. </li>
          <li>It needed to fixed upon a line-height issue we had.</li>
          <li>It needed to render a sharp a wide range of pixel density displays</li>
        </ol>


      <p> We started analysing all glyphs of the typeface under all conditions, determining how the next iteration of our product typeface should evolve. We referenced clear typefaces like San Francisco and Proxima Nova, which were developed with multi devices in mind.
