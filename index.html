      <!-- <br> -->
      <h3> Overview</h3>
      <p>
      In 2016 I had the opportunity to explore design solutions outside of our product portfolio. Nutanix Smart Bezel was the result of that exercise. At its core the project created an abstraction that allowed communication between server infrastructure, our installation and management platforms  through a combination of hardware and software.</p>

      <h3>The problem</h3>

      <p>
        Nutanix hardware installation process was fragmented. Datacenter admins needed to keep track on the inventory and the state of each piece of hardware through an excell sheet, retype network information manually to another platform and use this same information to register the product. An inefficient and costly process to company, partners and our customers that was prone to human error as it relies on administrators to keep track of all moving parts.
      </p>

      <h3>The challenge</h3>

      <p>Nutanix during that period provided only <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software' target="_blank">on-premises</a> solutions. For the vast majority of our clients that meant that no communication outside the datacenter for security purposes.
      <br><br>
      To create a secure channel I needed a way to establish a local connection between the hardware and the system, for this reason using a companion app as the orchestration layer was a core part of this concept. It was portable, accesible and easy to develop a prototype for a POC.</p>

    <br>
      <p>After pitching the idea to my colleagues we decided to utilize a piece of hardware that traditionally gets removed from the chasis, the bezel of the block as the missing piece to link the hardware and our app.</p>
    <h3>Time to refresh </h3>
    <p> During the company's hackathon we had time to decipher the details of how to make this work. I posted at that moment our 3 designers team in the list of project participating. A couple of hours later we had 3 engineers interested in helping develop this concept further.
    We started by designing the newly conceptualized bezel. We had in our ranks a designer with some previous industrial design experience, he helped shaping the final concept of the bezel we end up using. <br><br> The final concept integrated a <span id='rainbow'>255 color LED</span> strip we could use to transmit status information from the hardware back to our admins, and a NFC sticker placed behind the inner side of the bezel, this will allow the application to read the harwared information encoded.

    <h3>The companion app </h3>
    <p >
      Our next goal was to create the app that would be used as a conduit between our hardware inventory, imaging and management platforms. <br> For our proof of concept we defaulted using Android as our team felt the most comfortable with, and used our management platform (Prism) as a target. For our concept:

      <ol type="A">
        <li>The application would manage inventory by adding blocks through scanning of the bezel. </li>
        <li>Once added, the app can be registered to the target platform.</li>
        <li>By selecting the blocks, the app will communicate the hardware details to Prism, effectively registering the block.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Server room 3D mapping </h3>
    <p> It was during the concept phase for the companion app in which I discussed the possibility of leveraging some of the smartphone functionality to determing positioning of the phone during a registration event. This would allow the user to create a 3D space of the server room. This would make hardware troubleshooting more efficient and provide our users with a more reach experience of their data-center. The techinical details of how we achieve this are listed in our <u>patent application.</u></p>
