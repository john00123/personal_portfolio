      This project was an opportunity to explore design solutions outside our product portfolio. At its core, the concept improved and simplified the datacenter admin experience by creating an orchestration layer between the infrastructure and its management platform through a combination of hardware and software.</p>

      <h3>Some context</h3>

      <p>
        Back in 2016 <a href='https://www.webscaleworks.com/Hardware-Platforms.asp' target="_blank">Nutanix hardware</a> installation process was fragmented. Datacenter admins needed to keep track of hardware inventory (usually through an excell sheet), manually enter network information to install our OS in a different interface and register the product in a third. An inefficient and costly process to company, partners and customers that was prone to data-entry error, as it relied on administrators to keep track of all moving parts.
        <br><br>
        During that period the company provided <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software' target="_blank">on-premises</a> solutions. That meant for the vast majority of our clients the information privacy required no communication outside of the datacenter.
      </p>

      <h3>An unconventional solution</h3>
      <p> The solution was defined by the following design goals:
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Improving the datacenter admin efficiency by reducing manual data-entry.</li>
          <li>Simplifying the installation process by reducing the amount of services they need to interact.</li>
          <li>Enriching the hardware troubleshooting experience by providing more precise information of the datacenter.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
      To be able to achieve this, a local and secure channel of communication to the system needed to be established between the hardware and management platform (Prism). The final concept included a two things: A <span class='highlight'> mobile app (A) </span>, that was to become both the inventory and the orchestration layer, allowing the datacenter admin to configure and share infrastructure information, and a <span class='highlight'>smart bezel (B)</span> with a NFC tag inside containing basic device information needed for pairing.</p>

      <p> I pitched this idea to a couple of colleagues, that later expanded to a team of 6 including 3 back-end engineers and 3 designers. We used the company's hackthon to develop this concept to a working proof of concept</p>

    <h3>A. Companion app </h3>
    <p>
      The mobile app desing improved efficency of creating and mantaining a hardware inventory database, at the same time it was in charge of pairing with the imagining and management services. <br> For our proof of concept we defaulted using Android as our team felt the most comfortable with, and used our management platform (Prism) as a target. The main taskflows included:

      <ol type="A">
        <li>Adding blocks through scanning of the bezel to create an inventory. </li>
        <li>Once added, the app can be registered to the target platform.</li>
        <li>By selecting the blocks, the app will communicate the hardware details to Prism, effectively registering the block.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    The application goal was to be minimal, unobtrusive. The user experience and visual language were focused on making the app simple to use and fast to use. Adding hardware to the inventory was a common task for a datacenter admin so we wanted to make it a frictionless experience.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Smart bezel </h3>
    <p>
    We had in our ranks a designer with some previous industrial design experience, he helped shaping the final concept of the bezel we end up using. <br><br> The final concept integrated a <span id='rainbow'>255 color LED</span> strip we could use to transmit status information from the hardware back to our admin and our NFC sticker placed behind the inner side of the bezel with the necesary hardware information to create a link to the app.

    <h3> A richer troubleshooting experience </h3>
    <p>
      We expanded the original concept for both the bezel and the mobile app to allow datacenter information to be captured locally by using the smartphone functionality by determining the position of the phone during a registration event. This would allow the user to create a 3D space of the server room. The techinical details of how we achieve this are listed in our <u>patent application.</u> </p>

      <p>
      In addition, the smart bezel onced paired with the management service would be able to show system information trhough the stip. We captured a couple of use cases for the demo that included:</p>
      <ol type="A">
        <li>Block hardware error. </li>
        <li>Software operations, like updating that are taking place in a specific piece of hardware.</li>
      </ol><br>

    <h3>UX Design awards nomination</h3>
    <p> In 2018 two years after this concept was showcased in the company, we earned a nomination as part of the IFA Consumer Electronic's UX Design awards in Berlin, an international competition for user-centric design solutions that utilize state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
