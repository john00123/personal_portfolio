      </p>

<!-- Intro -->
      <p>
      In this project, I had the opportunity to explore design solutions outside our product portfolio. <br>During that time, I saw an area were design could have a significant impact. The blocks installation experience.</p>


<!-- Context -->
      <h3>Some context</h3>

      <p>
        Back in 2016, <a href='https://www.webscaleworks.com/Hardware-Platforms.asp' target="_blank">Nutanix hardware</a> installation process was fragmented across multiple platforms that didn't communicate with each other. This forced datacenter admins to retype information and keep track of every change throughout the installation process. It was for lack of a better term an inefficient and error-prone process to the company, partners, and customers who had to go through installing our hardware.
        <br><br>
        Nutanix, at the moment, provided <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-premises_software' target="_blank">on-premises</a> solutions. Which meant that data privacy was of the utmost importance; this was something I needed to consider if I was to try to solve for the datacenter admin issues.
      </p>

<!-- Goals -->


      <h3>Goals and team</h3>
      <p> The first step of this process was to have clarity of the problem that I was trying to solve. I captured the installation pain-points and translate them to goals for the project:
        <ol type="A">
          <li>Reduce tedious manual data-entry workflows.</li>
          <li>Reduce the number of services they needed to interact with</li>
          <li>Provide more precise information from the hardware for troubleshooting.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the company hackathon was around the corner, I wanted to use this opportunity to build something creative, elegant, but at the same time with useful applications for the datacenter operations.</p> <p>I pitched the general idea to a couple of co-workers that wanted to participate in the project. Later that week three back-end engineers reached out completing a group of 6. The team was essential to the success of the project, each one with a complementary skill set that took this project from an idea into a working prototype. </p>

        <p>
        I wanted to revise our bezel as part of this project, at the moment, its design was outdated and in need of a refresh. This became the place in which we could add some intelligence with the hopes of creating a local and secure communication channel between the hardware and management platform Prism. <br><br>Our final concept consisted of:

      <ul>
        <li>A <span> mobile app</span>, to become the block inventory and orchestration layer.</li>

        <li>A <span>smart bezel</span> with NFC technology, containing necessary device information needed for pairing.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>



<!-- Companion app -->

    <h3>A. Companion app </h3>
    <p>
        The application goal was to be minimal, unobtrusive. The user experience and visual language were focused on making the app focused and fast to use. Adding hardware to the inventory was a task our admins will perform multiple times in a day, so we wanted to make it a frictionless as possible. Below the interaction details of the most critical workflows for the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Managing inventory </b><br>
      To add a block to the catalogue, you just needed to scan the faceplate. All required information was encoded in an NFC sticker on the back of the bezel. This would remove the need of having to manually input block data into excel.

      <div class='block'  layout='‚ä°'  >
        <dialog>
          <br><h2>Block registered </h2>
          <p> Some information here </p>
        </dialog>
        <div class='phone' layout='‚ä°'></div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
      <p><b>Registering Blocks</b><br>
      Once a block appears in the list, you can select and add it to Prism or any other service that required the block information. The app was in charge of passing block data back and forward, guaranteeing data integrity in each step of the installation.

      <div class='block'  layout='‚ä°'  >
        <dialog>
          <br><h2>Block registered </h2>
          <p> Some information here </p>
        </dialog>
        <div class='phone' layout='‚ä°'></div>
      </div>
    </p>

    <br>
      <p><b>Datacenter Mapping</b><br>
      Using the smartphone position, we could determine the coordinates of the block during a registration event. This would help create a 3-dimensional representation of the datacenter. The information was processed in-device, keeping the information securely within the confines of the local network but allowing datacenter administrator to better determine the exact position of failing hardware.
    </p>




<!-- Smart Bezel -->


    <h3>B. Smart bezel </h3>
    <p>
    We had in our ranks a designer with some previous industrial design experience, he helped to shape the final concept of the bezel we end up using. <br><br> The concept integrated a <span id='rainbow'>255 color LED</span> strip we could use to transmit status information from the hardware back to our admin and our NFC sticker placed behind the inner side of the bezel with the required hardware information to pair.
    </p>

    <figcaption>Design concepts for the bezel</figcaption><br>
    <p>The final faceplate used a modern design language and proposed using premium materials for its construction, once paired with the management service would be able to show system information through the stip. We captured a couple of use cases for the demo that included:</p>
    <ol type="A">
      <li>Block hardware error. </li>
      <li>Software operations, like updating that is taking place in a specific piece of hardware.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> A working prototype </h3>
    <p> Thanks to a clear goal and effort from the team, delivered a working prototype of the app, the bezel functionality and a excellent pitch for our C-level executives that earned us the award for most creative in that year's hackathon.</p>
    <p> In 2018 we were nominated to the UX Design awards - IFA Consumer Electronic's in Berlin, an international competition for user-centric design solutions that utilize state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
