      <h3> Overview</h3>
      <p>
      In 2015 I had the opportunity to explore design solutions outside of our product portfolio, Nutanix Smart Bezel was the result of that exercise. At its core this faceplate was designed to allow communication between the server infrastructure and Nutanix management platform (Prism). </p>

      <h3>The problem</h3>

      <p>
        Nutanix node installation process was fragmented across several interfaces. A datacenter admin needed to manually keep track on the inventory and the state of each piece of hardware through an excell sheet. An inefficient and costly process to company, partners and our customers that was prone to human error as it rely on admins to keep track of all moving parts. Visits to our datacenter and interviews with our own datacenter admin showcased these issues at length.

      <h3>An unconventional solution</h3>

      <p>Nutanix at the moment provided <u>on-premise</u> solutions. For the vast majority of our clients that meant that no communication outside the datacenter.

      To create a secure channel I needed a way to create a local connection between the hardware and the system, for this reason using a companion app as the communication layer was a core part of this concept. A device connected to the local network can read some basic registration information from the hardware encoded via NFC plate.
    <br>
      After pitching the idea to my colleagues we decided utilize a piece of hardware that traditionally gets removed from the chasis, the bezel of the node and improve upon this.</p>

    <h3> It's all about teamwork </h3>
    <p> During the company's hackathon we had time to decipher the details of how to make this work. I posted our all-design team in the list of project participating. A couple of hours later we had 3 engineers interested in helping develop this concept even further.

    <b>Spoiler alert!</b> At the end of our hackathon we had a working prototype that pairs the device and the plarform directly.</p>

    <h3>Opportunity </h3>
    <p> It was during the concept phase for the commpanion app in which I thought to leverage some of the smartphone functionality to enhance the concept even further by detecting the relative positioning of the phone during a registration event. This will allow the user to create a 3D space of the server room, information that can be use to make hardware troubleshooting more efficient. The techinical details of how we achieve this are listed in our <u>patent application</u>. It was this idea and the work of the team that led the project to win a nomination to the UX awards in Berlin during IFA event floor.</p>
