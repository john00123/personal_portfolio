When it came to smaller devices and lower resolution screens, our font became hard to read.


typography is such an essential part of moder itnerfaces, they are the bulding blocks of the digital experiences we create, in our case in particular given that we work in such a data heavy interface even more imporant.

Text and typography often defin an interface, the majority of the real-state of our product is constitude by text, for me it was important to have a well crafted font that represented our design direction.
(replace look and feel with aesthetics)

We wnated a typace that had petsonality, but it that had function and scale too.

Considering different screen size, devices and the responsive nature of design.

There was a lot of work to make the font legible. With Nutanix soft we considered what it takes to take a rounded font like ours and hit that the right balance between, clear shapes and personality.

We draw inspirations from fonts like Proxima Nova and San Fransisco, we wanted to make the font still very familiar to what we had in the past, but bring those modern characteristics to our products.

We retouched the... and the apertures of the font, which makes most of the ... letters easier to read.

A big undertaking, took several variations of over 12312321 characters to get it right. We had discussion of the slightest details.


For our product team, it was improtnat to distribute the font as much as possible. All designers were able to download Nutanix Soft and start creating interfaces, for the most part the process was gradual as we allowed coexistence in design since we couldn't migrate all designs to use it. But all new ones should be using Nutanix Soft.

The UI 2.0 was also a great way to accelerate the distribution as part of our guidelines. The engineering team spend more time to add the typeface. Once we were confident that we had no projects using the old typeface we stopped support. This had made the process almost invisible for some.

We tested all this changes across different sizes. We decided to increase the range of weights that we offered in our font.

Nutanix Soft has 5 different weights from thin to bold.
These changes allowed us to be able to have a wider rande of typographic hierarchy in the UI while keeping that clean look.

Heres an example of how Nutanix Soft influenced the way we use typography in our UI to define hierarchy. Our thinner font became our title font, this gave our UI are cleaner an more spacious feeling from what it was before.



The next stage for the font is to evolve in a way the it becomes a unified font across product and marketing, today we approach typography in a different way and I believe type is a good way we can drive visual alignment between these groups. A multidisciplinary typeface that is good on marketing and inside the our UI. Airbnb with cereal is a great example of a company that has succesfully achieved this.

We are evaluating the use of bold in the product. We have seen that there is no usage for Bold today and it creates a childish look that stirs aways from the aesthetic we want to review those shapes.


I like to thing of font in the digital era like products, their design is not like in older times where it was printed in a sheet of metal and solidified the concept of a typeface, today we can make changes add weights, consider options like dynamic fonts in UI.
